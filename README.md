## 📚 LITERATURE REVIEW

In recent years, digital fitness platforms have integrated artificial intelligence to enhance user engagement and personalization.  
Studies indicate that AI-assisted workouts improve consistency and reduce dropout rates by providing tailored feedback and adaptive routines.

**Key inspirations & influences:**
- AI-driven personalization using rule-based and ML-enhanced logic.
- React-based Single Page Applications (SPAs) for smooth UI and quick transitions.
- Tailwind CSS for modular, consistent, and aesthetic design.
- Amazon RDS for reliable and scalable fitness data storage.
- Node.js for building lightweight REST APIs with real-time data access.

AI Fitness Coach merges these proven approaches into a cohesive application, offering both efficiency and personalization to end users.
